                Java is a programming language and computing platform 
                first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from
                 humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world,
                  by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and 
                  applications are built. New, innovative products and digital
                   services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.
